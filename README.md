# LocalizationAlgorithm-SUTD

The map from exploration will be used for creating a connected graph to represent its environmental structures and connectivity using this package. Then, some
vertices from the generated graph will be chosen as the robot positions.

## Dependencies
* ROS2

>  This package has been tested on ROS2 Humble, Ubuntu 22.04
  
### Building
Clone the code and compile it as follows

    cd ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/chathushkadhr/LocalizationAlgorithm-SUTD.git
    git checkout ros2
    cd ../
    colcon build --packages-up-to tuw_multi_robot_msgs --symlink-install
    source install/setup.bash    
    colcon build --symlink-install
    source install/setup.bash    

### Running the package 
    ros2 launch best_vertices best_vertices_node.launch.py env:= <map_name> n_robots:=<number_of_robots> human_pos:=<coordinates> radius:=<float>
##### Example 
    ros2 launch best_vertices best_vertices_node.launch.py env:=room_lvl7 n_robots:=6 human_pos:=[6.0,28.0] radius:=12.0


#### Note
* ‘human_pos’ must be an array of floats. Ex : [2.0,3.8]
* ‘radius’ must be a float
*  Parameters for graph generation is in the /best_vertices/config and must be changed according to the requirement

| /visualization_marker_array | visualization_msgs/msg/MarkerArray | Positions of the human and the robots, all vertices(for better visualization) |

### Parameters
* `n_robots` : Number of robots
* `human_pos` : Position of the human in the form [x,y] (not required to be a vertex of the graph)
* `radius` : Desired distance between robots (≤ communication range)
* `env` : Name of the environment
